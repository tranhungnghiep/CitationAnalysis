### Citation Analysis on the Microsoft Academic Graph Dataset

This contains some old code fragments for the citation analysis experiments in the past. The results were not reported formally but these codes are open sourced in case someone may find them useful. Note that the codes are old and some practices may have become outdated.

The codes concern the analysis and prediction of citation count of papers in a scholarly dataset, and may demonstrate two techniques:

- Using `pandas` for feature engineering on graph data, demonstrating basic pandas' operations as well as some tricky computations on graph data.

- Using `sklearn` for simple machine learning pipeline setup, with feature transforming, some simple modeling, model selection by grid search CV.
